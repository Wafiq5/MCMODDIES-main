### Original description:

Tired of the same old blue diamonds? This mod adds 6 new diamond variants to Minecraft! From trash-tier tools to OP gear, there's a lot to mess around with.

## **What's in the mod?**
- Six new diamonds: Purple, Orange, Red, Yellow, Green, and the legendary Rainbow Diamond.
- Tools for each type: some are weak and barely worth crafting, while others are absolutely broken.
- Rainbow Diamond tools: The best of the best.
If you love collecting shiny stuff or just want to dominate your world, give this mod a try.
